⚙️ VS Code Settings

This repository stores my settings.json for Visual Studio Code, used for personal development and 42 projects.

🚀 How to use

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/antonioamandio/vscode-settigns.git


Copy the settings.json file to your VS Code settings folder:

Linux: ~/.config/Code/User/

macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/

Windows: %APPDATA%\Code\User\

⚠️ This will overwrite your current settings. Make a backup first if you want to keep them.
